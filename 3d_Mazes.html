    <p>Open Usd is a platform aimed at being a universal file interchange system for 3d model and animations. It was originally developed by Pixar for their animated films, but was released as open source in 2016. In 2023, the ‘Alliance for OpenUsd’ was announced, including such founding members as Adobe, NVIDIA and Autodesk. Its purpose is to promote the standardisation and growth of the software, under the theory that the wide adoption of a standard and high-quality ecosystem will boost the ability of everyone who works with 3d models.</p>
   <br>
   <p>As part of that, NVIDIA has provided a series of free online courses for their Python Usd API, which allows for programmatic interaction with the system. After finishing the first half of their training, I decided to have a go at bringing an old maze generation project of mine into 3d. </p>
