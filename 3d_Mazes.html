    <p>Open Usd is a platform aimed at being a universal file interchange system for 3d model and animations. It was originally developed by Pixar for their animated films, but was released as open source in 2016. In 2023, the ‘Alliance for OpenUsd’ was announced, including such founding members as Adobe, NVIDIA and Autodesk. Its purpose is to promote the standardisation and growth of the software, under the theory that the wide adoption of a standard and high-quality ecosystem will boost the ability of everyone who works with 3d models.</p>
   <br>
   <p>As part of that, NVIDIA has provided a series of free online courses for their Python Usd API, which allows for programmatic interaction with the system. After finishing the first half of their training, I decided to have a go at bringing an old maze generation project of mine into 3d. </p>

    <h2>Code Walkthrough</h2>
    <p>The maze generator is in javascript and it’s producing a Json file that looks like <div class="code-snippet">{"0,0":{"x":0,"y":0,"links":[[1,0]]}, "1,0":{"x":1,"y":0,"links":[[0,0],[2,0]]}</div> Each object saves an X and Y grid location and then the X and Y of their linked cells. </p>
    <br>
    <p>There’s some extra data, because I’m saving the cell’s coordinates as both the dictionary key and in the x and y values, but that’s mostly just for readability. I throw the keys away immediately, because I only need the values.</p>
    <br>
    <p>We then take that list of cells and, iterating through them, we find the corner locations, and use them plus half a cell to find the centre location, which I place a parent transform at.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Then, we test if the coordinates for a neighbour cell are in the linked cells list, if they aren’t, we would like to place a wall. We only make the north or west walls if we're at the edge of the maze, to avoid duplicate geometry.</p>
    <br>
    <p>When I first tried to do this, I got far too many walls and a strange diagonal line through the middle. Using some print statements, I was able to find out that only connections with symmetrical coordinates ([0, 0], [1, 1], [5, 5]) were being correctly processed, and it was because I got X and Y mixed up earlier in the code. </p>
    <br>
    <p>Once we’ve identified that we want to place a wall, it’s just a matter of creating a cube of the correct dimensions and moving it to the right place.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I’ve had some issues with z-fighting on corners and there’s two ways I could solve them. On the one hand, I could change the system to be creating an entire solid mesh out of the maze by defining vertices. That would preclude arbitrary meshes though, and I think those are more useful for games. Instead, when I upgrade this to use arbitrary meshes, I’ll ask the user for a corner mesh, which will make the maze overall more interesting too.</p>
