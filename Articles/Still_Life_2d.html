    <p>A mystery/escape room game about solving puzzles in a strange art installation. Made in Unity, with scans me and my dad made of pressed flowers and a friend who made the music.</p>

      <summary>Retrospective thoughts</summary>
      <p>I'd been getting very into ARG's at the time, and I think that made me a bit overzealous with some of the puzzles, especially the angel's sword. I was very proud of the trick to the last puzzle, using normal maps to hide clues until the light hit them just right, but I didn't test the lighting enough, and they ended up a bit obvious even before the spotlight begins to highlight them.</p>
