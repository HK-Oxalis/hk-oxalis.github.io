        <h2> Introduction </h2>
        <p>For the GMTK game jam 2025, after my failure to follow through last year, I decided to stick with something that felt achievable but had space for ambition.</p>
        <p>The theme was 'loop', so my concept was Black Hole Billiards, a game where you try and control planets in orbit around you and land them in pockets to score points.</p>
        <p>And instead of fussing around with pixel art or 3d models, I was going to do all the art through shaders!</p>
        <p>Here's each of those shaders one by one!</p>

        <p>For the titular player avatar, I kind of cheated to get the right effect. Of course, a real black hole's appearance is based on complex light physics in the void of space, but this one is basically a paper cut-out and a ping-pong ball.</p>

        <p>The orange corona effect is made out of two pieces, pictured below, and I use polar coordinates to scroll noise over it, creating the spiralling effect. </p>
