      <summary>Retrospective thoughts</summary>
      <p> The final game needed to be more colourful than my initial ideas to fully show off the 2d artist's skills, but I'm happy with the way my effects work in colour or in full monochrome. I'm also proud of my idea to use the distance from the camera to calculate the crosshatching strength.</p>
