    <h2>The Resonant Sceptre</h2>
    <p>A story based RPG made in Unity as a college group project with a visual style inspired by wood cut illustrations. Model in image made by my classmate Harley W.

      <p> The final game needed to be more colourful to fully show off the 2d artist's skills, but I'm happy with the way my effects work in colour or in full monochrome. I'm also proud of my idea to use the distance from the camera to calculate the crosshatching strength.</p>
