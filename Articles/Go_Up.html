    <p>A atmospheric visual novel using assets from the classic development kit Hypercard. Made solo in Python, with most assets modified from a Ren'Py Hypercard framework.</p>

      <summary>Retrospective thoughts</summary>
      <p>This was my first finished game, two years ago as of writing this, and I'm actually quite proud of it still. There's a lot of technical issues (I really should go back and fix the font colour on the choices), but the general atmophere is really solid. The eye in the art museum is definitely a highlight (go toward the horribly scaled light in the distance a few levels up if you want to see it!)</p>
      <br>
      <p>If there's anything to learn from this, it's that I should use asset packs more. I've wasted a lot of time of asset production lately.</p>
