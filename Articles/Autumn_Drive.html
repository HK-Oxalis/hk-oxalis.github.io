    <p>A simple driving game about exploring a peaceful environment made for the Cozy Fall Jam 2024. Made solo in Godot, making heavy use of Blender's Geometry nodes and with stock music.

      <summary>Retrospective thoughts</summary>
      <p>As my first foray into Geometry Nodes, I'm happy with what I managed. As a game that I wanted other people to play, I'm not thrilled with the performance, and I forgot that Godot 4 didn't support C# on web, so I couldn't release a web build. It certainly captures the right 'vibe', however, and it was good to get my head around Godot's 3D side.</p>
