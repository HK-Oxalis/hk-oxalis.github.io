    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>One of my programming inspirations is the youtube channel The Coding Train, which frequently features breakdowns and implementations of scholarly articles that can be used for generative art. While I started watching as a beginner, I’ve recently found some success looking into their source material for more information. </p>

<p>I’ve also been trying to learn the processing-adjacent library OpenFrameworks, which isn’t covered by the Coding Train channel, so I decided to go searching out my own source to re-implement. </p>

<p>This project is an implementation of the lichen pattern generation algorithm described by Robert Sumner in his thesis, Pattern Formation in Lichen. It’s written in C++ using the OpenFrameworks library, and I did it without any external resources beyond the OpenFrameworks documentation
