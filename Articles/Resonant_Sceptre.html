    <h1>Summary</h1>
    <p>For our final major project in college, we were tasked with getting into groups and making a game. I was the group leader of 5 students and decided to focus on making shaders to bring the 3d and 2d specialist's work together.</p>
    <p>Here I'm going to talk through the work I'm most proud of from the project, the shader that recreates wood cut markmaking.</p>

    <h1>System</h1>
    <p>The shader is based off basic 1-bit dithering principles, where we compare the darkness of the current pixel to a dithering texture to decide whether to use the dithered colour or the base colour. The difference here is that the 'darkness' the shader looks at is not the literal colour or lighting data, but instead a value computed based on the camera data. It's also done in the material colour, not as a post-process effect.</p>

    <p>One of the influences on the 'darkness' value is the dot product between the camera direction and the normal vector, which is then increased by a nudge control. This creates shading on more sharply angled faces, dulling or even blacking them out, which helps show the contour of a model. The control is also very important so users can push this influence to be more or less significant on different materials.</p>

    <p>A similar thing is done with the distance between the camera and the section of the model. The controls here are in a remap node, which translates to an effect on the range of distances the shader reacts to. This is useful for objects of different sizes, after all, a difference of 1m for a chair is going to be much more significant than for a castle.</p>
