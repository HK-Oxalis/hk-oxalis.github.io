    <h2>Petals in the wind</h2>
    <p>A semi-puzzle game about planting flowers strategically to get the most points. Made solo in Godot, with a few free background assets</p>

      <summary>Retrospective thoughts</summary>
      <p>This was my first success at coding truly original gameplay, instead of the simple walking simulator and visual novel stuff I'd done before, and it was a real confidence boost. The systems came together in such a satisfying way, and I was able to use Godot's resource and Ui systems to make code that felt really professional, abstraction and composition and all.</p>
