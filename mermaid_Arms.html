    <p>So what's the big deal with arms anyway? I though ball joints were the gold standard for articulation?</p>
    <p>Well, yes, but a single ball joint can only do so much. The socket it's in limits its range, and there's only so much it can do without popping out and looking strange.</p>
    <p>This is a problem I saw most clearly when I made a mistake with my first mermaid's arms.</p>

    <p>It looks weird, yes, but even freed from a socket, the forearm still can't move that much. This is where double-jointing comes in.</p>
