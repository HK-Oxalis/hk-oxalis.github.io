   <h1>The Problem</h1>
    <p>So what's the big deal with arms anyway? I though ball joints were the gold standard for articulation?</p>
    <p>Well, yes, but a single ball joint can only do so much. The socket it's in limits its range, and there's only so much it can do without popping out and looking strange.</p>
    <p>This is a problem I saw most clearly when I made a mistake with my first mermaid's arms.</p>

    <p>It looks weird, yes, but even freed from a socket, the forearm still can't move that much. This is where double-jointing comes in.</p>

  <h1>Double Joints</h1>
  <p>The most basic description of a ball joint is that you have 1. a ball and 2. a socket. Thys, the ideal articulation is a perfect sphere with a perfect socket that can rotate all the way around it. This isn't possible with a strung joint, but keep it in mind</p>
  <p>The way I've been making joints so far is that one section of limb has a ball and the end, and the matching one has a socket. This naturally limits the rotation because no limb is naturally a perfect sphere.</p>
  <p>So... What if we did put a sphere in there? And made each limb end in a socket? That's the principle of double ball joints.</p>
