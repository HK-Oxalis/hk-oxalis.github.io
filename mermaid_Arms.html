   <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p>So what's the big deal with arms anyway? I thought ball joints were the gold standard for articulation?</p>
    <p>Well, yes, but a single ball joint can only do so much. The socket it's in limits its range, and there's only so much it can do without popping out and looking strange.</p>
    <p>This is a problem I saw most clearly when I made a mistake with my first mermaid's arms.</p>

    <p>It looks weird, yes, but even freed from a socket, the forearm still can't move that much. This is where double-jointing comes in.</p>

  <h2>Double Joints</h2>
  <p>The most basic description of a ball joint is that you have 1. a ball and 2. a socket. Thys, the ideal articulation is a perfect sphere with a perfect socket that can rotate all the way around it. This isn't possible with a strung joint, but keep it in mind</p>
  <p>The way I've been making joints so far is that one section of limb has a ball and the end, and the matching one has a socket. This naturally limits the rotation because no limb is naturally a perfect sphere.</p>
  <p>So... What if we did put a sphere in there? And made each limb end in a socket? That's the principle of double ball joints.</p>

  <h2>Shoulders</h2>
  <p>My first thought for the shoulders was just to use a cup shape, so not to disrupt the arm silhouette. The way I'm printing these leaves most peices a bit chunky, especially after paint and varnish.</p>
  <p>You don't get the full benefit of the ball joint, but I thought it would be enough. In retrospect, I think I should have leaned into the chunkiness and chosen a ball joint anyway, because I'm not sure how much the shoulder cups are giving to the arms at all.</p>
  <p>That's for my next project though. My upgraded mermaid works out well anough with these joints, by the most rigorous metric of doll articulation.</p>
