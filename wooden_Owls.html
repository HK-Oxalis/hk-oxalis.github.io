    <h2>Wood Experimentation</h2>
    <p>I spent some time working with wood filament when I first started 3d printing, but I haven’t used it since I started making my own dolls. With the 
      potential for a craft fair coming up, I thought I’d revisit it to see if I could perfect my workflow for making simpler, low-cost items. </p>
    <br>
    <p>Painting a piece drives up the price I have to charge, because I need to prime and varnish too, 
      but wood is brittle and difficult to work with in post-processing, especially when you print multiple at the same time.</p>
    <p>Sure enough, these two-part owl figures I made in spring seem perfect, but my first try (front) leaves a lot to be desired. I used a script from the blog <a href="http://www.tridimake.com/2012/10/shades-of-brown-with-wood-filament-via.html">tridimake</a> to give the wood texture, but on this scale it loses too much of the detail.</p>
    <img src="" alt="Two rows of 3d printed owls on a cluttered, green work mat. There are five in the front row that are noticably rougher, with pronounced horizontal lines and splinter-like imperfections. The four in the back are larger and almost completely smooth.">
