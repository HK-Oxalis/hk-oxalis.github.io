The lower third of the cover is white and dedicated to the author names and title, but the upper section features an array of buttons on a green background.">
    <p>I recently bought this little book on button collecting, and I was inspired by it to have a go at designing my own. The section on the history of buttons in Britan was fascinating and it was really cool to see the patterns I'd noticed around me laid out like that.</p>
