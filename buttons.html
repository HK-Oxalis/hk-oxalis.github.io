    <h2>Inspiration</h2>
    <img class="img-bordered" src="Images/Buttons_Book_Cover.jpg" alt="The cover of Buttons by Alan and Gillian Meredith, part of the Shire Books series on British and specifically Yorkshire history. The lower third of the cover is white and dedicated to the author names and title, but the upper section features an array of buttons on a green background.">
    <p>I recently bought this little book on button collecting, and I was inspired by it to have a go at designing my own. The section on the history of buttons in Britan was fascinating and it was really cool to see the patterns I'd noticed around me laid out like that.</p>

  <h2>First Print</h2>
  <img src="Images/Button_Screenshot.png" alt="A screenshot of a 3d model of a button. There is a raised design on it, of a lotus flower surrounded by leaves, under a disk representing the moon or sun.">
  <img src="Images/Button_First_Print.jpg" alt="A 3d print of the previous model on a metal surface. The surface is slightly melted and uneven, and there are blobs and strings of filament between each design element.">
  <p>This is my first design in the modelling software, and the way it came out in my first, naive print. As you can see, stringing has broken up the patternâ€™s clarity quite a bit, and would take careful clipping to clean up.</p>
